## Supported Export Formats

### YOLO Format

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format is widely used for object detection tasks. When exporting to YOLO format, AnyLabeling generates:

- Text files (*.txt) for each image with normalized bounding box coordinates
- A classes.txt file containing the list of class names

**Format structure:**
```
<class_id> <center_x> <center_y> <width> <height>
```
Where all values are normalized between 0 and 1, relative to the image dimensions.

**Use case:** Training YOLO models like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and other variants.

### COCO Format

COCO (Common Objects in Context) is a comprehensive format that supports object detection, segmentation, and keypoint annotations.

**Key features:**
- JSON-based annotation format
- Support for multiple annotation types (bounding boxes, polygons, etc.)
- Includes metadata about images and categories

**Use case:** Training models with frameworks that support COCO format, like Detectron2, MMDetection, or TensorFlow Object Detection API.

### Pascal VOC Format

Pascal VOC is an XML-based annotation format used in the Visual Object Classes challenges.

**Format structure:**
- XML files for each image containing information about the image and annotations
- Includes bounding box coordinates in absolute pixel values

**Use case:** Training models with older frameworks or when working with systems that specifically require VOC format.

### CreateML Format

CreateML format is designed for use with Apple's CreateML tool for training machine learning models on macOS.

**Format structure:**
- JSON format specifying annotations
- Designed to work seamlessly with Apple's ecosystem

**Use case:** Training models for iOS/macOS applications using Apple's CreateML.

## How to Export Data

1. Click on the **Tools** menu in the top navigation bar
2. Select **Export Annotations** to open the export dialog
3. Select the export format you want to use and click **Export**

Other settings are available in the export dialog.
