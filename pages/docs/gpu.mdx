# GPU Acceleration for Model Infererence

GPU acceleration is available for model inference to speed up the process. To enable this feature, you will need a GPU with CUDA support and use corresponding version of AnyLabeling.

## For PyPi Installation

Install the GPU version of AnyLabeling with the following command:

```bash
pip install anylabeling-gpu
```

## For Binary Installation

If you download the binary version of AnyLabeling from the [Releases](https://github.com/vietanhdev/anylabeling/releases), please choose the binary file with `GPU` in its name.

## For Source Installation

If you are using AnyLabeling from source, please set `__preferred_device__` to `GPU` in `anylabeling/app_info.py` file to enable GPU acceleration. The final code should look like this:

```python
__appname__ = "AnyLabeling"
__appdescription__ = "Effortless data labeling with AI support"
__version__ = "0.2.19"
__preferred_device__ = "GPU"  # GPU or CPU
```
