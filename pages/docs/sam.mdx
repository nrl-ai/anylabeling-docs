# Auto labeling with Segment Anything Model

[Segment Anything Model](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/segment-anything-foundation-model-image-segmentation/) is new segmentation model from Meta. Trained with 11M images and 1B segmentation masks, it can segment objects in the image without being trained on specific objects. For this reason, Segment Anything is a good candidate for auto labeling, even for new objects.

## Instructions

![Auto labeling with Segment Anything Model](/images/segment-anything-tools.png)

- Select **Brain Button** on the left side to activate auto labeling.
- Select one of the **Segment Anything Models** from the dropdown menu **Model**. The model accuracy and speed are different depending on the model. The **Segment Anything Model (ViT-B)** is the fastest and the least accurate. The **Segment Anything Model (ViT-H)** is the slowest and the most accurate. **Quant** indicates the quantization of the model.
- Use **Auto segmentation marking tools** to mark the object.
    + **+Point:** Add a point that belongs to the object.
    + **-Point:** Remove a point that you want to exclude from the object.
    + **+Rect:** Draw a rectangle that contains the object. Segment Anything will automatically segment the object.
    + **Clear:** Clear all auto segmentation markings.
    + **Finish Object (f):** Finish the current marking. After finishing the object, you can enter the label name and save the object.

## Note

- In the first time of running any model, AnyLabeling needs to download the model from the server. Therefore, it may takes a while depending on the network speed.
- The first AI inference also takes time. Please be patient.
- A background task is running to calculate "encoder" for Segment Anything Model. Therefore, it may take a shorter time for auto segmentation in the next images.
